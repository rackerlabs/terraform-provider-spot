The `ondemandnodepool` resource is designed to manage Ondemand Node Pools within a specified cloudspace. Users have the flexibility to create multiple ondemand node pools, each uniquely configured according to their requirements. These pools are then associated with a specific cloudspace using the cloudspace_name attribute. This setup allows for efficient allocation and management of resources in a cloud environment, enabling users to optimize their cloud infrastructure based on varying workloads and demands.
