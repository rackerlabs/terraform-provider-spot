# spot_ondemandnodepool Resource

The `ondemandnodepool` resource is designed to manage Ondemand Node Pools within a specified cloudspace. Users have the flexibility to create multiple ondemand node pools, each uniquely configured according to their requirements. These pools are then associated with a specific cloudspace using the cloudspace_name attribute. This setup allows for efficient allocation and management of resources in a cloud environment, enabling users to optimize their cloud infrastructure based on varying workloads and demands.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Creates a ondemand node pool with a two servers of class gp.vs1.small-dfw.
resource "spot_ondemandnodepool" "example" {
  cloudspace_name = "example"
  server_class    = "gp.vs1.small-dfw"
}
```
